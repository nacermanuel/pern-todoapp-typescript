Deployed app: <a href="https://todoapp-pern.web.app/" target="_blank">https://todoapp-pern.web.app/</a>
<br><br>
This is #REACTJS web application.
<br>
Since, there will be a lot of interaction and manipulation of ‘tasks’ I decided to manage a global state using #REDUX. 
<br>
I used the #TAILWINDCSS framework and the #MaterialUI components library to create a great UI.
<br>
I used #JSON-web-token for user authentication.<br>
The backend was built with #NODEJS using #TYPESCRIPT and the #EXPRESS framework. 
<br>
A CRUD API was implemented to manage users and tasks. I utilized #SEQUELIZE as the ORM and #POSTGRESQL cloud-based database provided by #RAILWAY.
<br>
To handle responsibilities in a decoupled manner and facilitate easy modifications, we adopted a clean architecture.
<br>
For frontend deployment, we are using #FIREBASE. 
<br>
For backend deployment, we have opted for #RAILWAY."
